            Hey! I was someone who didnâ€™t believe that AI is possible and can be so useful to make an impact on people's day-to-day life and make tasks so easy from writing, summarizing to advance use in medicine surgeries, etc. ChatGPT saved me so much time and I slowly felt the impact and I think it'll be more than what it is today. I want to spread this awareness and make an impact in people's lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a 3rd-year B.Tech student. I love creating real-life ML applications and participating in Kaggle competitions. Currently, I am impressed by agentic AI and exploring MLOps. I am dedicated to making simple yet impactful solutions that can make our lives easier and save us time.
